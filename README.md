# ORS 653.295

ORS 653.295 is Oregon's general employment noncompete statute. This repository contains plaintext files tracking amendments to Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 653.295 since it was enacted in 1977.

All plaintext contents have been extracted from the Oregon State Legislature's [ORS 1953-1997 Archives](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/), [ORS 1999-2017 Archives](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/ORSarchive.aspx), and [ORS 2019 Edition](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/ORS.aspx).

## About

I created this repo because I found the state-sponsored content to be difficult to access. At some point, I may add additional materials to this repository. Please submit a pull request if you would like to contribute.
