I extracted all plain text content from the Oregon State Legislature's [ORS 1953-1997 Archives](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/), [ORS 1999-2017 Archives](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/ORSarchive.aspx), and [ORS 2019 Edition](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/ORS.aspx).

## About

I created this repo because I found the state-sponsored content to be difficult to access and the amendments to this statute were hard to follow.

At some point, I may add additional materials to this repository. Please submit a pull request if you would like to contribute.
