## Background

This repository was created by me—Joel Christiansen—an Oregon employment lawyer and programmer. I created this repo to make it easier to visualize the amendments to ORS 653.295 over the years. I chose GitHub instead of other more conventional platforms because Git is really good at tracking changes to text. I share these materials publicly because I believe statutory text belongs in the public domain (i.e., open source).

## Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> The PDF version of the 2019 amendment links to the enacted bill rather than the statute. This is because ORS is published every two years. This link will be updated to reflect the ORS when it is published in 2021.
